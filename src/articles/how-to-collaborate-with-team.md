In ever changing world, we have to work with other people and Gaurilla makes it easy to collborate with your team on your account. Here's how to do it.

1. To go to collaboration center, click on **Collaborations** under the **Settings** menu from the left navigation bar.

2. This page shows you your own collborations and the collaborations for the company you're working in. Company's collaborations are on the left while yours are on the right.

3. Click on the **New** in the top-right corner to add collaborators in the currently selected company. A small window will open up.

4. Now, search your team member (or your accountant) using their email address. Remember, the collaborator must have a Gaurilla account. They will not be charged anything if they use their account just to collaborate. If they are not a Gaurilla user, send them an invitation from the same small window, and once they accept the invitaion, they will already be collaborating with you in this company.

5. When collaborating, you have two roles to assign to the collaborators.
	
	* **Subscriber:** Subscriber role gives them permission to view all the data in the company but not to make changes or create something new.
	* **Contributor:** Contributor role gives them persmission to view as well as make changes in the company. They have full permission to do anything.
