You can grant access to your clients in order to make them see all their respective invoices.

1. Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace for the company whose clients you want to grant access.

2. As you land on the dashboard, click on **People** >> **Clients** option in the main navigation bar.

	![clients-window]()

3. You can use the client filter adjacent to main navigation to filter out client whom you want to grant access.

	![clients-filter]()

4. After filtering out client, you will find an option **Grant Access** at the bottom extreme left corner of the window adjacent to the filter.

	!['client-grant-access-option']()

5. As you click on that option, a window will pop up asking you **Email** and **Password**. Fill both the fields and click on **Save** to complete the granting process.

	!['client-grant-access-window']()

	>> **Pro Tip:** Email and password you assign your client will be its login credentials in client console, so it will be good for them if you assign an email id which they are using.

6. Once done, your client is granted access to client console.

	>> **Note** **Edit Access** option can be used to edit the **Email** and **Password** of a particular client and **Revoke Access** option to revoke the permission of a client.
