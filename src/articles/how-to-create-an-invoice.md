Invoice is a document that you give to your customer that clearly states how much she owes you, for what and on what terms. Creating a invoice in Gaurilla is very simple.

- Step 1: Login into your Gaurilla account and set the workspace in which you wish to generate an invoice.

- Step 2: As you land on the dashboard with all sort of options around you, click on the “Slips” button which you will find just below the dashboard icon.

- Step 3: At the top right corner the “New” button is what you are looking for in order to generate an invoice.

- Step 4: The new slip window will have all the options to enter all the details which you need to specify in order to generate your invoice.

- Step 5: As you find the type of slip by default is checked to invoice, enter the invoice number you wish to give to your invoice. Today's date will be mentioned in the invoice by default but can be changed by user.
