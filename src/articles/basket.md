We, businessmen, have kind of been old fashioned in the way we keep our financial documents. Some are hardcopy, some are soft, some are in emails, some are receipts lying in our wallets. This kinda suck, right?

### Possible Use Cases

- You need to handover all your bank statements, bills, receipts to your accountant, but this is a tiring job, for you as well as your accountant. You can keep these documents updated in your Gaurilla account, add your accountant as collaborator and voila, she can filter through them whenever she needs to.

- You and your co-founder live in two different cities (or two different countries), keep the documents you each have in one common place, i.e. Basket, to have a hassle-free records.

- You go out and get many receipts that you have to add in your financial data, simply click the image and upload in your account.

Use cases are many and even we are eager to see how creative you all get in using Basket.

### Basket through Email

We understand that how we keep receiving bank statements, card statements in our inboxes, and they always stay there. It’d mean so much more if there existed an easy way to keep them in one place. Well, now we have.

You can forward those emails directly from your inbox to your Gaurilla account and all the attachments in the email will be added in your basket.

To leverage the feature (along with many others), you will need to first create the brand name for your company, which you can do so by clicking on the company’s name in the top-left corner.

Once you have your brand name in place, click on the **New** button in the Basket to reveal your unique email address. Anything that we receive on this email address will be added to your Basket, hence, we recommend you to keep it safe.
