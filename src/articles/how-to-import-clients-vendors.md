Switching from another app to Gaurilla? Well, we have got you an easy way to import your customers from previous app to this one. Let's find out how.

*For now, we support importing from CSV and XLS files only. In future, we will open up other methods too.*

1. Click on your company name in the top-left corner and then on **Import** to start importing.

3. An modal window will open with options ***Bank Statement***, ***Card Statement***, ***Clients***, ***Vendors***. Click on the either **Clients** or **Vendors**, depending upon your needs.
	
	***Note:** The file you upload should be a .xls or .csv file only.*
	
	***Note:** There should be atleast one column in your file and maximum of **8**. You have option to import these fields for each client: *Client*/*Vendor*, *Company*, *Address*, *City*, *State*, *PIN*, *Phone*, *E Mail*, out of which *Client*/*Vendor* field is mandatory.*

4. After uploading the file you will be redirected to **Mapping** window where you have to map the uploaded file's columns. We have tried our best to match the column headings with that of your files, but you are free to make the required changes.

5. Once done, click on the **Map** button at the bottom extreme right corner and the data will be imported in the background. It may take a couple of minutes before all the data is imported in your account. We will send you an email when the import is done.
