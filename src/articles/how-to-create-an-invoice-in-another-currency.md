5. Now follow steps you usually do while creating (normal or recurring) invoice.

6. Once you are done, whether creating normal invoice or recurring invoice, check the **Currency** option in the **Publish** form. It is by default set to your accounting currency. You can select the currency fron the drop down menu in which you want to create invoice. In **Rate** field you have to fill the exchange rate.

	>**Pro Tip:** Fill the current exchange rate if possible. 

7. Once done, click on **Publish** button and the invoice (normal or recurring) will be created in that particular currency.
